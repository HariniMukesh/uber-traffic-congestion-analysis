# Uber Traffic Congestion Analysis 🚗📊

## Project Overview
This project analyses Uber traffic data to identify congestion patterns and predict traffic volume during peak hours using machine learning techniques.

## Objectives
- Identify peak traffic hours
- Analyse congestion trends
- Build a predictive model for traffic volume
- Provide insights useful for urban traffic planning

## Dataset
- Source: Uber traffic data (CSV files)
- Features include time, location, traffic volume, congestion level

## Project Structure
- Data/ → Raw and processed datasets
- Notebooks/ → EDA, data integration, modelling
- Reports/ → PDF analysis and insights
- README.md → Project documentation

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository  
2. Install dependencies  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run notebooks in this order:
   - Data Integration
   - EDA
   - Peak Hour Analysis
   - Model Building

## Results
- Identified peak congestion during morning and evening hours
- Predictive model achieved reasonable accuracy in forecasting traffic volume

## Future Improvements
- Add time-series models (ARIMA / LSTM)
- Build a Streamlit dashboard
- Use real-time traffic data
